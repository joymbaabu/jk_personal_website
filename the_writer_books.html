                            - one on cummonity leadership and the other on democracy and good governance, both with humurous illustrations to help the readers have fun and insights as they read. &nbsp;The intention of the handbook is to build capacity
                            of cummonity leaders to mobilize and lead small and large groups using democratic and good governance ideals. This way, communities become stronger, more resilient, innovative, independent and achieve sustainable development.
                            They become less reliant on donors, governments and other outsiders for their survival and growth, and instead, become important partners in development.</p>

                            42 communities of Kenya into a united and formidable one nation-state. Division along the diverse ethnicites, religions, tribes and cultures was becoming a source of violent conflict especially during elections time, when politicians
                            could manipulate these diversities negatively to create strife and division so as to achieve their narrow and selfish interests. One way to minimize negative effects of divisions is through civic education, where citizens are
                            encouraged and equipped with knowledge, skills and attitudes that enable them to view and use their diversities as sources of beauty and strength, appreciate each other and rally together towards meaningful development and

                            public university students and university administrators <br>on ways they can meaningfully engage to work out issues affecting students amicably thereby reduce strikes and other violent methods of expressing unresolved grievances.
                            It was written when it was commonplace for university students to riot on the streets every time they were unhappy, injuring innocent motorists, pedestrians, fellow students, and rooting and destroying property of innocent
                            business people. The handbook is a resource that helps in understanding the effects of violence, and spurs readers to embrace the many nonviolent strategies available in resolving conflicts amicably and transforming institutions
